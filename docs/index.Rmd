## Bio

Faith Okoro is a Pre-Medical Computational Biology student with a minor in Programming and
computation, in addition to a minor in museum studies. My research is focused on using exploratory data analysis to study the effects of mixed contaminants like pesticides and pharmaceuticals on urban stream ecosystems. 

My studies in programming and computation provide the essential toolkit for me to transform complex biological data into predictive models for solution-building.
Complementing this scientific framework is my passion for museum studies and learning how to curate complex stories and make specialized knowledge accessible and impactful for a diverse audience.
